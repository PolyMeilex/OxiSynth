# OxiSynth

OxiSynth is a pure safe Rust SoundFontâ„¢ synthesizer, inspired by the widely known `FluidSynth`.  

## Primary Use Case  
Initially designed for integration with [Neothesia](https://github.com/PolyMeilex/Neothesia), OxiSynth has expanded its utility to other innovative projects, including:  
- [microwave](https://github.com/Woyten/tune/tree/main/microwave): A microtonal synthesizer that makes creative use of OxiSynth's per-channel tuning APIs.  
- [xsynth](https://github.com/BlackMIDIDevs/xsynth): A Black MIDI synthesizer leveraging OxiSynth's `soundfont` parsing crate.

## Showcase

This is how OxiSynth sounds like, running in real-time in [Neothesia](https://github.com/PolyMeilex/Neothesia)

The chorus and reverb in the recording are also produced by `oxisynth-chorus` and `oxisynth-reverb` crates respectively, that don't have any dependency on `oxisynth` itself and can be used as generic efects outside of this project.

### WASM as first class target

OxiSynth was built with WASM in mind from the get go, so here it is running in the browser, with Boomwhacker soundfont prebundled:
